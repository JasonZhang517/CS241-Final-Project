# CS241-Final-Project
This is the final course project of CS241 Principle and Practice of Problem Solving, using Qt creator to implement a Ride Hailing Analysis System.

The code and runnable software pack is in the repository.
Click finalproject.exe then you can use it.

The demo video is too large to be uploaded, so I submitted it to bilibili.

It is strongly recommanded to watch the demo to know what I done and the result.
